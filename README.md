# ObjectDetection-YOLOv3
A small project, implemented with YOLOv3 using PyTorch DL framework.

Here is what the output looks like:

I tried to create this project from scratch, following the instructions of [this Paperspace blog](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/), which has 5 parts in total. I explored how this algorithms work, read the sample codes and modified it to make sure I can understand most of the concepts behind it.

This repo doesn't have a code for training weights, I just use the pre-trained weights provided by the author.
